# Calmarendian Date
## The Calendar of Lorelei
The planet of [Calmarendi](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/calmarendi-natasha-moorfield/a/calmarendi-article) takes, from the perspective of an observer from Earth, seven years to orbit its star. The [Calendar of Lorelei](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/calmarendi-natasha-moorfield/a/the-calendar-of-lorelei-article), which divides this orbital period into seven seasons of fifty weeks of seven days (plus a little bit added on to keep everything lined up) is what Calmarendians use to keep track of time.

## The npm_calmarendian_date Package
This package provides a `CalmarendianDate` class which is to the Calendar of Lorelei what, in Python terms, `date` is to Earth's Gregorian Calendar. In particular, `CalmarendianDate` naively assumes that its calendar always was (and always will be) in effect even though it demonstrably was not.
